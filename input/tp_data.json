dissolution of transition metal components of the NCM cathode, which results in capacity attenuation because it can decrease Li+ insertion sites.\n[2] Moreover, the dissolution of transition metals even poses a problem to the anode through electrodeposition catalyzing electrolyte reduction and the formation of inorganic layers in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), all of which can impede Li+ intercalation and fade cell performance.\n[3] However, NCM stabilization by way of cathode additives remains inadequate, insufficient, or ineffective to date.\n[4] However, Si anodes, as one of the major components of cell chemistry for high energy density, have shown very poor cycling performance.\n[5] The main reason for their poor cycling performance is ascribed to their very large volume change during cycling, which increases internal resistance and loss of contact area.\n[6] This intrinsic problem associated with the Si material cannot be avoided, and a need exists for mitigating or significantly mitigating this problem.\n[7] However, electrolyte is reactive to the Ni species of high-Ni NCM, causing irreversible reaction(s) on the cathode and undesirably producing gas products.\n[8] More specifically, in a highly delithiated state, high-Ni NCM tends to generate large amounts of Ni4+ that can react with electrolyte.\n[9] This side reaction significantly thickens the cathode/electrolyte interface(s) and reduces the available Li ion source, thus increasing resistance.\n[10] The Ni4+ species cause increased evolution of gas products at upper cutoff voltages, relative to which cathodes with higher Ni content suffer from more parasitic reactions with Ni species.\n[11] An NCM based cathode with Ni-rich surfaces behaves differently than other cathodes with different lower proportions of Ni.\n[12] Another issue arising from such NCM dissolution involves in the production of resistive fluorinated transition metals as a side product on the surface of the NCM.\n[13] Certain cathode additives have been used in an attempt to stabilize the Ni-rich surface of NCM and prevent the dissolution of NCM transition metals.\n[14] To achieve high energy density lithium ion secondary batteries, silicon material is used for the anode because of its high gravimetric and volumetric capacity.\n[15] The very large change in volume affects SEI stability at the interface between the Si and the electrolyte, and consequently the SEI keeps breaking down and reforming during cycling.\n[16] The resulting thick SEI layer is harmful for cycle life, and causes a

terms of production, this demands that the support structure should form an at least downwardly sealed tray which prevents any escape of liquids under gravity in the event of damage (battery housing defect, accident, etc.).\n[2] In addition, the support structure should be sealed from the outside to the inside, for instance in order to prevent moisture and/or dirt from passing from the outside into the interior of the battery carrier frame, which could in turn increase the risk of short-circuits or other functional impairments.\n[3] Therefore, a construction of a support structure accommodating the battery should take account not only of the forces that arise during driving and the interaction of the support structure with the rest of the body, but also in particular the loads that arise in the event of a crash.\n[4] However, the metal profiles that are preferably used to produce the support structure have\u2014not least on account of employed profile lengths of sometimes much more than one meter\u2014dimensional deviations at the connecting points that are preferably to be joined in a cohesive manner (typically in the corner region of a frame), in particular twists which result in gaps or misalignment of the components to be connected in an order of magnitude, which, in particular in automated welding processes, but also during adhesive bonding operations and other cohesive connecting techniques, can cause problems in terms of strength and tightness of the connection and in process control and automation.\n[5] Therefore, it is desirable to provide a support frame for an electric vehicle battery, which is optimized in terms of tightness, compensation of component tolerances and load absorption in particular in the event of a crash, and can be welded readily in an automated manner.\n[6] Electric vehicles with a fully electric or at least partially electric or hybrid drive require\u2014depending on the drive concept\u2014the accommodation of batteries with a weight of up to several hundred kilograms.\n[7] The batteries should be arranged in a support structure that is sealed towards the outside, such that any leakage of a battery does not result in liquid escaping from the battery being able to pass into the environment.\n[8] Both of the abovementioned demands mean that the connection of the structural components from which the support structure accommodating the battery is constructed has to be sufficiently leak tight and stable.\n"}, {"instruction": "Extract the sentences related to technological problem", "input": "Consequently,
